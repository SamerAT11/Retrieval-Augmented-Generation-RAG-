        "We want our **dataset to be fully in English** so we can evaluate the RAG system better by ourselves, e.g. looking at the LangChain output. However, our current English dataset was manually translated from Google Translate with the context that none of us are fluent in Japanese.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these internet [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12ze6xx/gpt4_is_amazingly_good_at_translating_japanese/) and [article](https://medium.com/akvelon/is-gpt-4-better-at-translation-than-google-translate-2fd39730af0e), GPT for translation is actually the best since it accomodates context better. In my opinion, *dataset is the key*, so I think it's worth any money to make sure the dataset is in high quality.\n",

As a child, he moved multiple times between Tokyo, Hyogo, and Kagoshima due to his father's job. When he transferred schools in the 5th grade, he set a goal to read all the books in the library and read many books. At his graduation ceremony, he received an award called the 'Goethe Prize' for reading the most books and a lending record of bundled books. By chance, he joined the choir in junior high and dedicated his summer vacation to practice, achieving high rankings in prefectural choir competitions. In his first year of high school, he launched a magazine, but when his family moved from Kagoshima to Tokyo in his second year, he dropped out of high school and took the entrance exam for Aoyama High School, where he fortunately gained admission due to a vacancy. There, he challenged himself in wind music. He also participated in the brass band as a cheerleading squad for high school baseball. In university, he wrote serialized articles for the club's newsletter and was involved in publishing books. He had various part-time jobs and aspired to work in the mass media industry, but after appearing on a quiz show, he became interested in TV program production. After graduating from university, he was able to work in TV at a major advertising agency, where he was involved in planning and producing TV programs and handling all sponsorships. After working in the TV industry for about 3 years, he was assigned to handle a local expo for a municipality celebrating its 100th anniversary due to a job transfer. This led him to work on expo-related projects. At a major advertising agency, he worked in Nagoya and Gifu for a total of 17 years before being transferred to Tokyo. In Tokyo, he was involved in the publishing industry for a long time and was able to be involved in the launch of weekly and monthly magazines. He also participated in book fairs in Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul. After that, he focused on new business development and constantly challenged himself with new things. He also joined the company's choir and became involved in the Tokyo Choral Federation, which the choir was a member of. At the end of 2020, after working for 35 years at an advertising company, he established an LLC. He also signed a 10-year business commission contract with New Horizon Collective and became a professional partner. In the future, he hopes to secure a stable income through a new way of working and challenge himself in new business and things he wanted to do. On April 1, 1985, he joined Dentsu and was in charge of various industries such as TV media, local expos, local governments, electric power companies, housing, food, automobiles, distribution, mail order, telecommunications, finance, hotels, transportation, and publishing. He has a track record of acquiring over 140 new clients through new customer development. He has a track record in media planning, campaign planning, CI, IR, events (exhibitions, concerts), PR, facility construction and operation, consulting, and new business development (product development, store development, human resource development). He has a track record in motor shows and product development for miso companies (naming, package design). In October 2017, he obtained a miso sommelier certification. In 1995, he passed the domestic travel business handling manager exam and the event business manager exam. In 2008, he passed the environmental and social certification exam (eco certification) and obtained a CPA (Corporate Privacy Associate) license. In 2012, he passed the third-class FP (Financial Planner) exam and in 2015, he passed the basic web analytics exam. In 2016, he passed the AdWords Sales Exam and Digital Literacy Exam.

He then worked at Asahi Advertising before joining Dentsu in 2006, where he spent 15 years. At the end of 2020, he left Dentsu and founded Intervoice. The value proposition of Intervoice is to elevate the speed of client companies' strategic planning and execution, and to transform work styles through reforming marketing thinking and concepts. Despite majoring in literature and working at an advertising agency, he was reluctantly assigned to the accounting department as his first role, which did not motivate him at all. However, he reluctantly began studying accounting. Through the accumulation of study and practical experience, he deeply understood the importance of awareness of numbers. Since then, he has emphasized marketing strategies based on accounting insights. After two years in accounting, he transferred to the marketing department and devised a unique area marketing and regional branding method by combining commuter data held by railway companies, credit card purchase data, and resident data from map information systems. During his tenure at Asahi Advertising and Dentsu, he was involved in marketing and branding work for major domestic manufacturers, and was responsible for strategic planning for over 100 brands. In the process, he developed an original brand development program centered on 'dialogue' and 'interview' through extensive research work and workshop design. His main brands include Ajinomoto CookDo, Kirin Hyoketsu, Asahi Beverage WONDA, Kao Segreta, FUJIFILM ASTALIFT, and SUBARU LEVORG. He places 'building marketing strategies directly linked to sales expansion' at the core of strategic planning and brand development. In 2019, he moved his residence from Tokyo to Karuizawa Town in Nagano Prefecture, and has since been active primarily in Tokyo and Karuizawa.\"\n",

As a child, he moved multiple times between Tokyo, Hyogo, and Kagoshima due to his father's job. When he transferred schools in the 5th grade, he set a goal to read all the books in the library and read many books. At his graduation ceremony, he received an award called the 'Goethe Prize' for reading the most books and a lending record of bundled books. By chance, he joined the choir in junior high and dedicated his summer vacation to practice, achieving high rankings in prefectural choir competitions. In his first year of high school, he launched a magazine, but when his family moved from Kagoshima to Tokyo in his second year, he dropped out of high school and took the entrance exam for Aoyama High School, where he fortunately gained admission due to a vacancy. There, he challenged himself in wind music. He also participated in the brass band as a cheerleading squad for high school baseball. In university, he wrote serialized articles for the club's newsletter and was involved in publishing books. He had various part-time jobs and aspired to work in the mass media industry, but after appearing on a quiz show, he became interested in TV program production. After graduating from university, he was able to work in TV at a major advertising agency, where he was involved in planning and producing TV programs and handling all sponsorships. After working in the TV industry for about 3 years, he was assigned to handle a local expo for a municipality celebrating its 100th anniversary due to a job transfer. This led him to work on expo-related projects. At a major advertising agency, he worked in Nagoya and Gifu for a total of 17 years before being transferred to Tokyo. In Tokyo, he was involved in the publishing industry for a long time and was able to be involved in the launch of weekly and monthly magazines. He also participated in book fairs in Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul. After that, he focused on new business development and constantly challenged himself with new things. He also joined the company's choir and became involved in the Tokyo Choral Federation, which the choir was a member of. At the end of 2020, after working for 35 years at an advertising company, he established an LLC. He also signed a 10-year business commission contract with New Horizon Collective and became a professional partner. In the future, he hopes to secure a stable income through a new way of working and challenge himself in new business and things he wanted to do. On April 1, 1985, he joined Dentsu and was in charge of various industries such as TV media, local expos, local governments, electric power companies, housing, food, automobiles, distribution, mail order, telecommunications, finance, hotels, transportation, and publishing. He has a track record of acquiring over 140 new clients through new customer development. He has a track record in media planning, campaign planning, CI, IR, events (exhibitions, concerts), PR, facility construction and operation, consulting, and new business development (product development, store development, human resource development). He has a track record in motor shows and product development for miso companies (naming, package design). In October 2017, he obtained a miso sommelier certification. In 1995, he passed the domestic travel business handling manager exam and the event business manager exam. In 2008, he passed the environmental and social certification exam (eco certification) and obtained a CPA (Corporate Privacy Associate) license. In 2012, he passed the third-class FP (Financial Planner) exam and in 2015, he passed the basic web analytics exam. In 2016, he passed the AdWords Sales Exam and Digital Literacy Exam.

The value proposition of Intervoice is to elevate the speed of client companies' strategic planning and execution, and to transform work styles through reforming marketing thinking and concepts. Despite majoring in literature and working at an advertising agency, he was reluctantly assigned to the accounting department as his first role, which did not motivate him at all. However, he reluctantly began studying accounting. Through the accumulation of study and practical experience, he deeply understood the importance of awareness of numbers. Since then, he has emphasized marketing strategies based on accounting insights. After two years in accounting, he transferred to the marketing department and devised a unique area marketing and regional branding method by combining commuter data held by railway companies, credit card purchase data, and resident data from map information systems. During his tenure at Asahi Advertising and Dentsu, he was involved in marketing and branding work for major domestic manufacturers, and was responsible for strategic planning for over 100 brands. In the process, he developed an original brand development program centered on 'dialogue' and 'interview' through extensive research work and workshop design. His main brands include Ajinomoto CookDo, Kirin Hyoketsu, Asahi Beverage WONDA, Kao Segreta, FUJIFILM ASTALIFT, and SUBARU LEVORG. He places 'building marketing strategies directly linked to sales expansion' at the core of strategic planning and brand development.
