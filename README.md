# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-
Enhancing ChatGPT with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Response Capabilities

This project focused on augmenting large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate real-time data and improve response accuracy and relevance. Developed a system to fetch, preprocess, and utilize live data from recruitment profiles to tailor ChatGPT's responses for specific inquiries in professional contexts. Implemented two RAG models using different frameworks and datasets to compare performance, demonstrating significant improvements in model responsiveness and information relevance. Evaluated models using a custom RAG assessment system, ensuring robust and reliable application performance.

Technologies Used: LangChain, OpenAI APIs, various Python libraries including sentence transformers, FAISS for vector handling, and additional tools for document processing.

Outcomes:
* Enabled dynamic data processing capabilities in LLMs, leading to improved accuracy and relevancy of model responses in real-time applications. This work underscores the potential for LLMs to interact effectively with external databases, significantly enhancing their applicability in diverse fields such as data retrieval and content generation.
* Successfully integrated RAG with ChatGPT, enhancing its ability to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses based on real-time data. The project provided insights into the practical deployment and scalability of LLMs in dynamic environments.
