As a child, he moved multiple times between Tokyo, Hyogo, and Kagoshima due to his father's job. When he transferred schools in the 5th grade, he set a goal to read all the books in the library and read many books. At his graduation ceremony, he received an award called the 'Goethe Prize' for reading the most books and a lending record of bundled books. By chance, he joined the choir in junior high and dedicated his summer vacation to practice, achieving high rankings in prefectural choir competitions. In his first year of high school, he launched a magazine, but when his family moved from Kagoshima to Tokyo in his second year, he dropped out of high school and took the entrance exam for Aoyama High School, where he fortunately gained admission due to a vacancy. There, he challenged himself in wind music. He also participated in the brass band as a cheerleading squad for high school baseball. In university, he wrote serialized articles for the club's newsletter and was involved in publishing books. He had various part-time jobs and aspired to work in the mass media industry, but after appearing on a quiz show, he became interested in TV program production. After graduating from university, he was able to work in TV at a major advertising agency, where he was involved in planning and producing TV programs and handling all sponsorships. After working in the TV industry for about 3 years, he was assigned to handle a local expo for a municipality celebrating its 100th anniversary due to a job transfer. This led him to work on expo-related projects. At a major advertising agency, he worked in Nagoya and Gifu for a total of 17 years before being transferred to Tokyo.
